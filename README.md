# Udacity Full Stack Nanodegree - Section 1 Project
## About
I created a simple webpage based on a pdf design from class. I built the webpage using github's very own [Atom text editor](https://atom.io/).
and I made it responsive using components from the popular [bootstrap framework](https://getbootstrap.com/).

* [Proj1.html](https://github.com/vandyand/Section-One-Project/blob/master/Proj1.html) contains the html code for building the site.
* [style.css](https://github.com/vandyand/Section-One-Project/blob/master/style.css) contains the css code for styling the site.

## How to Use
* Download code or clone repository to your system.
* Make sure all files are in the same directory.
* Open Proj1.html from your browser or execute it using command prompt or file explorer.
* Site will display in browser.
